                <h1>Mahmoud Osman</h1>
                <p>A Hard-Worker, I Work On Myself Everyday.</p>
                <p>
                    From Lebanon, Currently 16 Years Old, I Have a Vision, I Started 11 Months Ago With C/C++, Got an Excellent Experience With it (Also Assembly Language), Then I Learned About Binary Exploitaion (Security), i Did a lot of Binary Analysis And Exploitation, Then I Learned System Administration Under Linux, Now, Today, I Joined the Web Development World, Learning Currently HTML CSS, With Other Skills Not Related To IT Like Strength Building And Bodybuilding, Healthy Eating And Healthy Lifestyle, Natural Body Recovery, Explosive Human Power Development,  Social Engineering And Human Mind Reading Based On Some Analysis, How The Human-Mind Respond And React To Things That Happen, How To Control Other Peoples Chemical State Based On Your Visible Actions (Like All Of Those Stuffs Are Related To Social Engineering).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I Love What I'm Doing So I'll Continue Working On Myself, I Decided To Do Full Stack Web Development And Bug Bounty With a Little Bit Of Malware Development And Networking Skills, Rising Up, One Step At a Time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alot Of Disappointment, But I Don't Care About Anything, If You Didn't Reach The Moon, You'll Reach The Top, Keep On It, Work, Like a Machine.
                </p>
                <p>Like, I Did Alot Of Wrong Stuffs in This Year, My First Year, Every Start is a Failure, CZ it's Just To Teach You How To Start, After That, You'll Riseup Like an Air-Ballon, But, I learned Alot in Just 1 Year. Whatever.</p>
                <p>I Know it is a Hobby, But Will That Make Money Right Now ? So, I Decided About 19 Days Ago To Start Web Development. If You Want To Work With C/C++ Languages You'll Need 7+ Years Of Experience And Super-Super-Expert-Professional Skills, So, That Is Not Gonna Work With Me, However, I Still Love C/C++, I Still Work To Develop My Skills With C/C++ ! </p>
                <p>Now When I'm Coding This WebSite, I Am The Fuck So Depressed, With This Fucking bad economic situation in Lebanon, Less-Money, And Dreams, I Am A Fucking Hardworker, I Decided To Kill My Feelings, Fuck Feelings, Whatever Is Gonna Happen I DON'T CARE.</p>
                <p>This is My Current Stat, I Don't Know What Year You're Reading This, Maybe I'm Now a Successfull Man, Or I Have My Own Fucking Business, That Will Cost Me A Lot Of Years, I Am Ready To Join The Fight. FUCK FEELING.</p>
